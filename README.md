# About

RockinProjex is a fun web project suite. Currently, the first site is in development. This is going to be called, as my username suggests, RockinProjex. (RPX for short)

Eventually, I will not only have RockinProjex up, but I'll also get up other websites that will do other things. But for now, RPX is my focus.
